    Experimental OV7692 Driver for OMAP3-ISP
    
    This is an experimental OmniVision OV7692 driver for OMAP3-ISP.
    
    Assummed configuration:
    	* 8 bit parallel mode (CCDC)
    	* SBGGR8 format
    
    To use this driver:
    	1. Build this kernel module as an external module. Take a look at
    	   `install_native.sh` script.
    	2. Edit your device-tree structure. Look at ov7692 node in
    	   `omap3-overo-common-peripheral.dtsi` file for an example.
    	3. Initialize the driver, and ISP pipeline using the `init.sh` script.
    	4. Run these commands to capture raw image(s):
    		$ yavta -p -c10 -n1 -s640x480 -fSBGGR8 -Fimage-#.raw /dev/video2
    	5. Use `ufraw` tool on your host system to view the file:
    		$ ufraw iamge-000000.raw
    
    Currently this driver is not stable - multiple image captures often lockup the
    system.
